## Parking-Spot-Detection-and-Counter+
<br/>

This project is a Parking Spot Detection and Counter inspired by the Computer Vision Engineer YouTube channel. The project uses a pre-trained model from the channel to detect and count available parking spots in a given video or image feed. <br/>

## Features
* Detects parking spots in video or image feed
* Counts available and occupied spots
* Simple and modular code structure
* Sample videos and images for demonstration <br/>
<br/>

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Shah114/parking-spot-detection.git
    cd parking-spot-detection
   ```
2. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Extract the sample data:
   ```bash
   unzip sample.zip
   ```
<br/>

## Usage
1. Run the project:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
2. The main.py script will process the videos/images and display the results with detected parking spots.
3. Make sure that you add correct path for videos, images and model <br/>
<br/>

## Files
* main.py - Contains the main code for running the detection and counting.
* util.py - Utility functions for simplifying tasks like image processing.
* sample.zip - Contains sample videos and images for testing and visualizing the model. <br/>
<br/>

## Sample Data
The sample.zip file includes several videos and images that can be used to visualize how the model detects and counts parking spots. These can be found in the samples/ directory after extraction. <br/>
